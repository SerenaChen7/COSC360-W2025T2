# COSC360 – Client-side Experience Design (Winter 2025, Term 2)

This repository contains the **client-side experience design** for our COSC 360 group project.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

- User flow between pages

This submission focuses on **wireframes and mockups only**.  
No backend or functional implementation is included.

## Project Overview

Our application supports **three types of users**:

- **Guest** – can browse and search public courses

Authentication is required for personalized and management features.
